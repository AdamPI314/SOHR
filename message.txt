Merge fast transitions, for example A=B first order reaction, assume the forward and backward reactions are both
very fast, if we keep this fast transition in the network, this will result in long path in a short time range
Here is how we do it, the idea is to treat these two species as a single one
One philosophy is to minimize the change
1) set fast reaction rates to be zeros
2) append B's out nodes to A's out nodes list
3) Reactions flow into B are redirected to A
4) No change to B's pseudo-first order rate constant, and the corresponding integral over time, keep them in memory, not a big deal
but Change A's k in a way that first get rid of k_{AB}, and append B_{B's out but to A} to A
